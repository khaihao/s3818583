<li><h2> Interest in IT</h2></li>
<p> I am a person who loves technology very much and I always want to get know more about how technology effects and changes our world. I found my interest in IT when one day I borrowed my father's laptop for playing a game, unexpectedly all the applications in my dad laptop messed up and I couldn't access any files because I had the wrong click on some command that led to all the laptop files and application cannot open. My dad was so upset at that time and I tried to figure out what happened and fix that problem by using a PC looking for some method to fix that error. Finally I can make the laptop back to the original status and after that time I really want to know more about how computer systems run and I have been interested in IT by that moment


<p>I chose RMIT to study IT major because this school has a great international education environment and has an extremely good facility especially for students who study information technology because all the computer labs in RMIT are equipped with very powerful configurations for programming as well as computers that can run specialized software for information technology sessions.

<p>I expect in the course of information technology to train me the skills necessary to be able to manufacture and use technology to communicate and transfer information to many people. Moreover, I am looking forward to information technology that can help me connect with people more easily, so that people can communicate with each other anywhere in the world.

<li><h2> Ideal Job</h2></li>
<img src="pic4.PNG" width="800px">
<p> First of all, this job appeals to me because I can work in a foreign environment and have many opportunities to learn and develop myself. Besides, the recruitment unit offers a lot of benefits for employees with a high salary and the 13th salary bonus for Tet. Finally, when I do this work here I have the opportunity to work with their partner, GoodData - a company from the United States which provides a massively scalable, secure & high-performance Insights Platform-as-a-Service for 70,000 businesses.

In order to apply for this job, I need to have a good English background to be able to communicate fluently with the Vertica Support Team. In addition, the ability to analyze and solve problems must be a strength in doing this job and must always know how to make quick decisions and explanations that always accompany the presentation. In addition, the job required to be capable of being independent and cooperative and have multitasking, priority work experience. It requires over 5 years of experience and it is accompanied by practical experience in relational database design, transactional SQL and DBMS (Vertica, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL or MSSQL).

For myself, my skills, experience as well as qualifications are not available. Because I just started college for a bachelor of information technology. Besides, at present, I have some knowledge about computer hardware and install the basic software needed for the computer system.
Preparing for a database administration position requires a lot of skill and experience. For someone just starting to learn information technology like me, I need to have a learning and working plan to gain experience to meet the requirements of a database administration position.
I plan to complete the bachelor of information technology program in the next 3,4 years and during this period I need to increase teamwork to increase teamwork and coordination. The group work for me can absorb many different sources of opinion and can make me decide quickly. Besides, I will search and join the database management groups to learn from many seniors and gain more knowledge as well as build relationships to get good help from everyone. When I was in sophomore year, I would study and learn more about transactions in SQL and DMB and try to find practical exercises to accumulate practical experience. When I graduate, I will look to small companies for internships and work. In order to help me become familiar with the working environment, communicate and especially gain more experience to be able to step into the position of good database administrator at a company or a corporation and build trust for everyone.

<p> After taking the test and getting results from 3 online test sites, these tests gave me a better understanding of who I am.
 The results from those tests help me to know more about how I view this life, how I handle problems and also clearly show me my working style as well as during the operation in a group.
 Furthermore,  the results from the Myers-Briggs test page caused me to change my behavior. Because those results offer advice and workarounds based on the mistakes that I am making.
 This will be very helpful for me when I am working in a group, it will help me to know what I am wrong and overcome so that I can adapt appropriately also leading to a good collaboration with all the group members and promote cooperation among members to come up with good ideas.
 Besides that, I can take advantage of all my strengths such as supportives, enthusiasm, good practical skills and more than that to assist and push all my teammates’s mentality up and probably learn from all my team members to fix all my weaknesses as well.

<li><h2> Idea Job</h2></li>
 <h3><u>Overview</u></h3>
 <p>You are an avid reader, finding everything through books and newspapers.
  Then this can be a very useful and valuable application for you.
  An application that captures and analyzes the cover image of a book, which contains the title, name and immediately gives reviews and feedback from those who have read it before.
  All information about that book will be collected, extracted and aggregated from reputable sources such as Goodreads, Amazon and a few other book platforms.
</p>

 <h3><u>Motivation</u></h3>
 <p>Books are an endless source of knowledge, there have been many books released and changed the lives and personalities of so many people.
  Since the printing technique was born in 1430 by Johannes Gutenberg, Germany, there have been more than 150 million different titles, carrying various content and genres published around the world.
  Because of the number of books and the variety, this makes it difficult and time-consuming for readers to find a book that suits their needs.
  Therefore, the Book Review & Recommendation application was created to limit these issues. Help readers find the right book faster, without spending too much time in the library, bookstore searching and reading through a variety of books.

</p>

 <h3><u>Description</u></h3>
 <p>This application is operated in a way that receives information and then analyzes and produces results. The Book Review & Recommendation application is divided into 4 parts. First is the homepage where suggested book templates based on your interests and personality. Such information will be collected from you when you register for an account to access the application. The second part will be where you can use the camera on your phone and capture the cover of the book, then the system will analyze and give reviews and feedback aggregated from many different book review platforms. Moreover, this app will also suggest similar books for you to have more choices to refer to. The third part will be a site that offers booksellers or libraries with books you want to find and gives you a place to buy or borrow. Doing so will save you a lot of time, without wasting time to search through bookstores to find the book you want. The last will be the page for you to give feedback, review and rating for the book you have read based on a 10-point scale to get more information for many references. Because it is a free app, instead of the publisher collecting money for you, you will instead contribute your comments about the book you have read in exchange for 2 times free access to get book information on the next time. The more you contribute, the more access times you are looking for free book information. This application will be released on 2 famous mobile platforms now as Android and IOS. You can download it on Google Play store for Android and App Store for IOS. In addition, this application will take up about 30Kb of your phone capacity and requires access to location and camera to be able to serve all your needs when you use the application. Besides, the application will be updated periodically once a month to update many new types of books and only for the feedback and reviews will be updated regularly and continuously in order to bring the latest information to the user.

</p>

 <h3><u>Tools and Technologies </u></h3>
 <p>To operate a mobile app developer will use IDE Pycharm in order to develop the software using Python for the main programming languages. The reason why using Pycharm
as IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is to minimize the amount of errors when writing using Python as the languages. As for the reason why we choose Python as the programming language, because of its reliability and efficiency. Besides, using Windows Azure or Amazon web services for the backend of the app. Because those 2 cloud computing services are the most popular and the most secure platform and most important is those 2 platforms bring a very high stability for running the server.

</p>

 <h3><u>Skill required </u></h3>
 <p>For the skills required for the development of this application the developer needs to have coding skills on Pythons, sufficient database skill, some soft skills, design skill and cloud infrastructure. Developers need to have a coding level on Pythons because that is the main programming language that contributes to operating this app. Database skill for managing the amount of information that the app will receive from the user. Design skill for the user interface. Seen we are using cloud computing services, we also need to have a sufficient cloud infrastructure skill so that we can navigate and fix errors, bugs that may arise when we publish our app.
</p>

 <h3><u>Outcomes</u> </h3>
  <p>If this application is widely known and widely used around the world, it will be a huge benefit to society, because it will encourage people to read more books to bring their knowledge to help the society. Besides, it will help us not to spend too much time and money searching for the books we want and when your time is saved, it means that you will have more time to read more books and receive a lot of things to yourself. Because books are an endless source of knowledge. And once again making the love reading book community more popular, developing and connecting more people to share, learning and improving knowledge.
